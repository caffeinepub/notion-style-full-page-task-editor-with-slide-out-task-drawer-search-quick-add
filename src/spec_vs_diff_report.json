  "summary": "Diff implements global dark theme application via adding the `dark` class on the root element and expanding global CSS variables/styles, plus adds/adjusts Task Drawer, Task Page, and Quill editor theming for visibility. However, some requested UI-only scope constraints appear to be exceeded (unrelated UI redesigns and hook changes referenced in summaries), and Task Page scrolling behavior cannot be fully verified from the truncated diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Scrolling within the Task Page works and content is not clipped by overflow/z-index issues.",
      "reason": "The Task Page root container is set to `overflow-hidden` (`<main className=\"... overflow-hidden\">`). The diff is truncated before showing any internal scroll container, so it is not verifiable that scrolling is enabled for the editor/content area and not clipped.",

      "reason": "Non-goals include adding new task features or changing task data models/APIs; the diff summary text claims hook changes to support full-page editor persistence, which goes beyond a pure UI/CSS visibility regression fix request.",
