      "requirement": "Provide proper PNG icon assets at 192x192 and 512x512 and ensure manifest references match the real image dimensions.",
      "reason": "The manifest was updated to reference 192x192 and 512x512 PNGs, but the diff summary does not show the required image files being added/updated, so their existence and correct dimensions cannot be verified from the diff.",
